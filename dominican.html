           <center> <p1> In 2012, the varsiity baseball team took a trip to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republice for spring training.
             This is a picture of me posing infront of a popular statue in the heart of the city. We played at on one of the most
             popular baseball fields in the DR. The talent level their shocked us as a team but we showed well on our trip.
