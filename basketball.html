           <center> <p1> From 2012-2016 I attended a boarding school in Western Massachusettes where I played basketball. 
             As A Freshman, I played on Varsity, and by Junior year I was co-captain with my roomate Trevor. We never won many games 
             but it was amazing playing basketball with my best friend.
